### cooperative development
when you first clone the project on your own workplace, please install dependencies firstly:

install the react app dependencies:
```
npm install
```
then install the backend dependencies (express, etc.):
```
cd backend
npm install
```
I packed a few more packages
front end: npm install axios jwt-decode react-router-dom
backend: npm install cors

When running, please run the backend first and then the frontend
